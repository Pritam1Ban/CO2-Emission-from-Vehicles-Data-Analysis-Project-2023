# CO2-Emission-from-Vehicles-Data-Analysis-Project-2023
This Project demonstrates the CO2 emission rates from different Vehicles and fuel category.

Following are the observations obtained: 

1. Visual 1: It suggests different number of vehicle and parts type provided in the dataset.
             4 types of Fuel, 7 types of Cylinder, 45 types of Engines, 39 types of Make, 16 types of vehicle class, 663 types of vehicles data has been provided. On CO2 emission, max of 488 units of CO2 can be seen, while having an average emission of 256 units, from vehicles.
             Now based on the 4 types of Fuels used in  vehicles,
                 i. Top 5 class of vehicles: SUV_small, SUV_standard, Two Seater, SubCompact, and Pickup_Truck_Small,
                 ii. Bottom 5 class of vehicles: Mid_size, Compact, Full_size, Pickup_Truck_Standard, and MiniCompact,
                 iii. Top 10 Transmission: M6, AS8, AS7, M5, AV, AV6, M7, AV7, AV8, AV9,
                 IV. Bottom 10 Transmission: A6, A8, A4, AM7, A5, A7, A9, AM6, AM5, AS4.
   2. Visual 2: In this Visual, different vehicle make and parts are compared using CO2 emission rate,
                  i. Top 5 Class of Vehicles: SUV_Small, SUV_Standard, Pickup_Truck_Small, Two_Seater, Sub_Compact,
                  ii. Bottom 5 Class of Vehicles: Mid_Size, Compact, Full_Size, Pickup_Truck_Standard, Mini_Compact,
                  iii. Top 5 Transmission: M6, AS8, AS7M5, and AV,
                  IV. Bottom 5 Transmission: A6, A8, A4, AM7, A5,
                  V. Top 5 Engine Size: 2.00, 3.60, 3.50, 3.00, 5.30,
                  vi. Bottom 5 Engine Size: 3.30, 6.80, 8.40, 1.20, 1.00. 
   3. Visual 3: A. Avg Fuel Consumption,
                    i. in City: 13,
                    ii. in Highway: 9,
                    iii. as Combination: 12,
                    iv. as Combination in MPG: 26.
               B. Top 5 vehicle class using Fuel in City, on Highway, as Combination, and as Combination in MPG, are
                       SUV_Small, SUV_Standard, Pickup_Truck, Two_Seater, and Sub_Compact.


Following are the key-insights:

                     Vehicles class: SUV_Small, SUV_Standard, Two_Seater are top most CO2 emission vehicles types and also, the most fuel consuming , as well, that are used in City, Highway, and as combination of both.
                     as for Transmission, M6, AS8, and AV Transmission types that are cause of most CO2 emission and as well as fuel consumption.
